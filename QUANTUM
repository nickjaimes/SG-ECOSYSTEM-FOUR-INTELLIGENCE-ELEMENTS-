✅ 1) QUANTUM (Base Concept)

✅ Definition

QUANTUM refers to the core computational philosophy/engine using:
   •   Quantum-inspired logic
   •   Probabilistic processing
   •   Parallelism
   •   Multi-state reasoning
   •   Optimization + fusion of inputs

It is a general-purpose, abstract computational layer designed to:
✔ handle uncertainty
✔ integrate multi-domain signals
✔ provide accelerated decision processing

This is the base unit behind many SG systems.

Think of QUANTUM as the “brain power model” — a method of thinking.

✅ Core Features
   •   Multi-state logic
   •   Probabilistic reasoning
   •   Superposition-like decision states
   •   Fast inference + optimization
   •   Scenario modeling
   •   Quantum-inspired search

✅ Simple analogy

Like a standard CPU instruction set—powerful alone, but not specialized.
